        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Elena, a 20 year old freshman at the Faculty of Computer Science & Engineering in Skopje.
            I'm a people person who enjoys meeting new individuals and learning something new everyday.
            I always find some common ground with everyone even if I have to get creative to do so.
            I'm very communicative, detail-oriented, and versatile. I like to think of myself as a team player.
            I'm always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills, whether it's through attending workshops,
            youth exchanges or training courses. By continually investing in my own growth, I'm able to share valuable insights with others.
            Looking ahead, I am excited to continue expanding my skills and taking on more challenging projects within my field of knowledge.

            <h3> Erasmus+ projects</h3>
            <img src="../images/bxs-plane.svg">
            <p> I Successfully took a part in an Erasmus+ Youth Exchange project named  ,,CUTE'' in Hungary where
                the overall aim and specific objectives achieved from this project were:
                To highlight shared values, initiate tolerance and acceptance for other cultures,
                to empower young people to realize needs, plan and take actions.
                I also took part in another project named ,,Natural Acceptance", which took place in Hungary.
                As a result of our project I improved the level of key competences of myself,
                increased solidarity and acceptance and enhanced self-expression. By the end of the
                exchange, I improved my learning performances and I increased my motivation for
                taking part in future informal and non-formal education or training abroad.

            <h3>Photograph</h3>
            <img src="../images/bxs-camera.svg">
            <p>Capturing moments through the lens is both an art and a passion that defines my photography.
                With an eye for detail and a keen sense of composition, I strive to immortalize the beauty
                and essence of the world around me. Each click of the shutter is a unique opportunity to freeze time,
                telling a story through the interplay of light, color, and emotion. From breathtaking landscapes to
                intimate portraits, my goal is to evoke a sense of wonder and connection in those who view my photographs.
                With every frame, I aim to create a visual narrative that sparks imagination and invites viewers to embark
                on their own visual journey. Photography is my way of preserving fleeting moments, making them timeless
                and cherished forever.

                The gym is my sanctuary, a place where sweat, determination, and passion converge.
                I wholeheartedly embrace the exhilarating journey of fitness, pushing my limits and discovering
                newfound strength with every workout. From the invigorating rhythm of my heartbeat to the satisfying
                burn in my muscles, the gym fuels my spirit and empowers me to reach new heights.
                It is within those walls that I find solace, focus, and an unwavering dedication to my well-being.
                With each rep, I am sculpting not only my physique but also my resilience and discipline.
                The gym is my sanctuary, where I am reminded that through hard work and perseverance,
                I can conquer any challenge and become the best version of myself.
